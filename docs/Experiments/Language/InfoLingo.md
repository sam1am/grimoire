## Alphabet and Symbols

1.  Utilize a 26-letter alphabet, numerals (0-9), and additional symbols (~!@#$%^&*-+=|/?<>).
2.  Introduce characters from other writing systems (e.g., Greek or Cyrillic) or create new characters to represent specific sounds or concepts.
3.  Assign specific meanings to symbols to represent common words or phrases, e.g., '@' for 'at', '+' for 'and', '>' for 'greater than'.


`*Alphbt&Symbols: 26-letters, nums(0-9), extras(~!@#$%^&*-+=|/?<>); add_chars(Greek/Cyrillic)4sounds/concepts; '@'=at, '+'=and, '>='=greater than.*`

## Phonetics and Pronunciation

1.  Maintain the 26-letter alphabet pronunciation but consider additional phonetic pronunciations for numerals and symbols when spoken.

`Phon&pronunc: keep26-letters, add_phon4nums&symbols💬.`
## Grammar

1.  Use a context-free grammar, allowing for flexible sentence structures while maintaining unambiguous relationships between the components of a sentence.
2.  Implement a robust system of prefixes, infixes, and suffixes to modify words and reduce the need for additional words.
3.  Utilize a consistent tense and aspect system, possibly through morphological markers or auxiliary verbs.
