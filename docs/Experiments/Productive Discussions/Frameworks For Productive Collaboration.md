## [[Nonviolent Communication (NVC)]]

Developed by Marshall Rosenberg, NVC emphasizes empathy, honesty, and active listening. It has four components: observations, feelings, needs, and requests. By focusing on these aspects, participants can express their viewpoints without judging or blaming others.

## [[Active Listening]]

Active listening involves giving your full attention to the speaker, asking open-ended questions, paraphrasing, and reflecting on what's being said. This technique helps participants feel heard and understood, reducing the potential for conflict.

## [[The Socratic Method]]

This approach involves asking thought-provoking questions to explore ideas and assumptions, encouraging critical thinking and open dialogue. The focus is on inquiry and understanding, rather than asserting one's own viewpoint.

## [[The Ladder of Inference]]

Introduced by Chris Argyris, this framework helps participants become aware of their own thought processes and assumptions, leading to more mindful communication. By recognizing and challenging their own inferences, individuals can avoid misunderstandings and conflicts.

## [[Fisher and Urys Getting to Yes]]

This negotiation framework focuses on finding common ground and win-win solutions. It encourages separating the people from the problem, focusing on interests instead of positions, inventing options for mutual gain, and using objective criteria.

## [[The Six Thinking Hats]]

Developed by Edward de Bono, this technique encourages participants to explore different perspectives by wearing different metaphorical "hats," representing different types of thinking (e.g., emotions, facts, creativity). This structured approach promotes open-mindedness and constructive discussion.
