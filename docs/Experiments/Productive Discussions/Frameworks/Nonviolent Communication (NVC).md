-   Developed by Marshall Rosenberg
-   Aims to facilitate empathetic, honest, and compassionate communication
-   Focuses on expressing needs and feelings without blame or judgment

### Four Components

#### 1. Observations

-   Describe the situation or behavior without evaluation or interpretation
-   Use specific, factual, and neutral language

Example: "I noticed you came home late last night" instead of "You're always late."

#### 2. Feelings

-   Express your emotions related to the observation
-   Avoid using words that imply judgment or evaluation

Example: "I felt worried" instead of "I felt like you don't care."

#### 3. Needs

-   Identify the underlying needs or values that are connected to your feelings
-   Focus on universal human needs, such as safety, connection, or understanding

Example: "My need for security was not met" instead of "You should have called me."

#### 4. Requests

-   Make a clear, specific, and doable request related to your needs
-   Use positive language and avoid demands

Example: "Could you please let me know if you'll be late in the future?" instead of "Don't be late again."
