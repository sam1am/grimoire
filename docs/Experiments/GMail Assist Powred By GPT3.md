I've tried all the services meant to help you wrangle your inbox. I've been overwhelmed by this since I got my gmail account the year gmail came out. The Google spam filter isn't enough to surface what is important and get rid of the rest. Unsubscribing is a never-ending battle. 

And now, a script that took a few hours to write can do a better job than all of the spam filters in the world. 

gmail-assist will search for all **unread** and **un-analyzed** emails in your gmail account. One by one it will score each one and label it as gptJunk, gptLow, gptNormal, gptImportant, gptUrgent. What you do with them from there is up to you.
