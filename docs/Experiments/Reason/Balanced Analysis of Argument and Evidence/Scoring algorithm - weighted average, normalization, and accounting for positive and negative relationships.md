In order to combine the individual scores for soundness, bias, logical consistency, and fallacious reasoning into a single final score for each argument, we propose a scoring algorithm that utilizes weighted averages, normalization, and accounts for the positive or negative relationship between the scores and the overall probability.

### Step 1: Assign weights to each scoring category

Assign weights to each scoring category based on their relative importance (e.g., soundness = 0.4, bias = 0.2, logical consistency = 0.3, fallacious reasoning = 0.1). The weights should sum to 1, and they can be adjusted based on which factors are considered most important.

### Step 2: Invert scores with negative relationships

For categories with a negative relationship with the overall probability (e.g., fallacious reasoning), invert the scores by subtracting the original score from the maximum possible score (10 in this case):

`Inverted Score = 10 - Original Score`

### Step 3: Calculate the weighted average

Compute the weighted average for each argument by multiplying the category scores (inverted, if necessary) by their respective weights and summing the results:

`Final Score = (soundness * soundness_weight) + (bias * bias_weight) + (logical consistency * consistency_weight) + (inverted_fallacious * fallacious_weight)`

### Step 4: Normalize the final scores

Normalize the final scores by dividing each score by the maximum possible weighted score (10 in this case), resulting in a range between 0 and 1:

`Normalized Final Score = Final Score / 10`

### Step 5: Use the normalized final scores in Bayes' theorem

The normalized final scores for the Mormon side (H1) and against the Mormon side (H2) can be used as probability estimates in the Bayes' theorem formula:

`P(H1|E) = P(E|H1) * P(H1) / (P(E|H1) * P(H1) + P(E|H2) * P(H2))`

It's important to note that this approach is not standard practice for incorporating qualitative scores into a Bayesian analysis. It's an attempt to provide an approximation of the probabilities based on the subjective scores assigned. The results should be interpreted with caution, and the scores should primarily serve to facilitate understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the arguments rather than providing definitive probabilities.

## Example

Based on the provided scores and weights, the calculation for the final score is as follows:

Invert the bias score to account for its negative relationship with the probability:

`Inverted bias score = 10 - bias score = 10 - (-10) = 20`

Compute the weighted average for the argument:

`Final score = (loudness * 0.4) + (20 * 0.2) + (puzzle * 0.3) + (-6 * 0.1) Final score = 1.2 + 4 + (-0.6) Final score = 4.6`

Normalize the final score by dividing by the maximum possible score of 10:

`Normalized final score = 4.6 / 10 = 0.46`

Using the normalized final score as the probability estimate, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

`P(H1|E) = P(E|H1) * P(H1) / (P(E|H1) * P(H1) + P(E|H2) * P(H2)) P(H1|E) = (0.46 * P(H1)) / (0.46 * P(H1) + (1 - P(H1)))`

Please note that this calculation is an approximation based on subjective scores, and should be interpreted with caution.
