## Outline

## Intro

Mormonism, officially known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is a religious movement that claims to be the restoration of the original Christian church. Founded by Joseph Smith in the early 19th century, Mormonism has attracted millions of followers worldwide and has become a significant cultural and religious force. However, it has also faced considerable criticism and skepticism from non-Mormons who question its historical accuracy, theological soundness, and controversial practices.

This report aims to analyze and evaluate some of the key arguments for and against Mormonism using a systematic approach that takes into account factors such as soundness, bias, logical consistency, and fallacious reasoning. By carefully weighing the strengths and weaknesses of each side's arguments and applying a scoring algorithm, we aim to provide a balanced assessment of Mormonism's overall credibility.

## Background

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was founded in 1830 by Joseph Smith after he claimed to have been visited by God the Father and Jesus Christ in 1820. Smith later translated what he believed to be an ancient record written on golden plates into the Book of Mormon. The church teaches that it is the restoration of the original Christian church with additional revelations from God.

Some key beliefs include:
- A belief in God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost as separate beings
- The necessity of modern prophets
- The importance of family relationships
- The practice of baptism for the dead
- A pre-mortal existence

## Methodology

To evaluate arguments for and against Mormonism, we will use a systematic approach that considers factors such as soundness (whether an argument is based on true premises), bias (whether an argument is influenced by personal beliefs or preferences), logical consistency (whether an argument follows logically from its premises), and fallacious reasoning (whether an argument relies on faulty reasoning or rhetorical tricks).

We will then apply a scoring algorithm to each argument, taking into account these factors and any positive or negative relationships between arguments. This will allow us to derive a final score for each argument, which can be used to gauge the overall credibility of Mormonism.

## Arguments in Favor of Mormonism

1. Personal spiritual experiences: Many Mormons claim to have had personal spiritual experiences that testify to the truthfulness of the church's teachings. These experiences may include feelings of peace, joy, or a sense of divine presence.

2. Witnesses: The Book of Mormon includes statements from three witnesses who claimed to have seen the1.  **Background**
