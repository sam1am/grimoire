Below is a reassessment of the arguments for each side, with explanations for each score:

### Mormon side

1.  **Personal spiritual experiences**
    
    -   Soundness: _3_ (Personal experiences are subjective and cannot be independently verified or falsified)
    -   Bias: _10_ (These experiences are influenced by personal beliefs and emotions and are therefore the definition of bias)
    -   Logical consistency: _4_ (Personal experiences can be coherent and internally consistent, but they may not align with external evidence)
    -   Fallacious reasoning: _6_ (While not necessarily fallacious, relying on personal experiences as evidence can be problematic due to their subjective nature)
2.  **Witnesses**
    
    -   Soundness: _7_ (The testimonies of the witnesses were documented, but they can't be independently verified)
    -   Bias: _6_ (Some witnesses had close relationships with Joseph Smith or the early church, which could influence their testimonies)
    -   Logical consistency: _9_ (The testimonies are generally consistent with one another)
    -   Fallacious reasoning: _7_ (Relying on the testimonies of a small group of witnesses can be problematic, especially if they have potential biases)
3.  **Consistency with biblical teachings**
    
    -   Soundness: _6_ (The teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints can be consistent with some biblical teachings, but may conflict with others)
    -   Bias: _7_ (Interpretations of biblical teachings can be influenced by personal beliefs and religious tradition)
    -   Logical consistency: _7_ (The church's teachings may be internally consistent, but their alignment with biblical teachings is subject to interpretation)
    -   Fallacious reasoning: _6_ (Appealing to the Bible as evidence assumes its authority and can be subject to confirmation bias)
4.  **The growth and impact of the Church**
    
    -   Soundness: _7_ (The growth and impact of the church are measurable, but their implications for the truth of its claims are subjective)
    -   Bias: _6_ (Attributing the growth and impact of the church to divine guidance can be influenced by personal beliefs)
    -   Logical consistency: _7_ (The argument is coherent, but it does not necessarily prove the church's claims)
    -   Fallacious reasoning: _5_ (The growth and impact of a religion do not necessarily imply divine guidance or truth; other religions have experienced growth and made positive impacts as well)
5.  **Complexity of the Book of Mormon**
    
    -   Soundness: _3_ (The complexity of the Book of Mormon is noteworthy, but it doesn't necessarily imply divine origin)
    -   Bias: _9_ (Assuming the complexity of the book implies divine origin can be influenced by personal beliefs)
    -   Logical consistency: _4_ (The argument is coherent, but doesn't support the conclusion.)
    -   Fallacious reasoning: _10_ (The complexity of a text does not necessarily imply divine origin; other complex texts have been produced by humans)

### Against Mormon side

1.  **Lack of physical evidence**
    -   Soundness: _10_ (There is indeed a lack of physical evidence to support the existence of the golden plates)
    -   Bias: _5_ (The absence of evidence is a valid concern, but it may not be sufficient to disprove the church's claims)
    -   Logical consistency: _10_ (The argument is coherent and supported by the available evidence)
    -   Fallacious reasoning: _3_ (The absence of evidence does not necessarily prove the nonexistence of the golden plates, but it does raise reasonable doubts)

2.  **Anachronisms and inaccuracies in the Book of Mormon**
    
    -   Soundness: _10_ (There are documented anachronisms and inaccuracies in the Book of Mormon)
    -   Bias: _2_ (Focusing on these issues may be seen as an attempt to discredit the church, but they are valid concerns)
    -   Logical consistency: _10_ (The argument is coherent and supported by the available evidence)
    -   Fallacious reasoning: _1_ (Pointing out anachronisms and inaccuracies does not necessarily disprove the church's claims, but it raises questions about their authenticity)
3.  **Plagiarism and similarities to other works**
    
    -   Soundness: _8_ (There are similarities between the Book of Mormon and other contemporary works, but whether they constitute plagiarism is debatable)
    -   Bias: _1_ (Highlighting these similarities may be seen as an attempt to discredit the church, but they are valid concerns)
    -   Logical consistency: _6_ (The argument is coherent, but the conclusion is not necessarily supported by the evidence)
    -   Fallacious reasoning: _5_ (Similarities to other works do not necessarily prove plagiarism or disprove the church's claims, but they raise questions about the Book of Mormon's origins)
4.  **The history and character of Joseph Smith**
    
    -   Soundness: _6_ (Joseph Smith's character and history can be relevant to the evaluation of his claims, but they don't necessarily disprove them)
    -   Bias: _2_ (Focusing on his character may be seen as an ad hominem attack, but it is relevant to the credibility of his claims)
    -   Logical consistency: _6_ (The argument is coherent, but the conclusion is not necessarily supported by the evidence)
    -   Fallacious reasoning: _6_ (While character and history are relevant, they do not necessarily disprove the church's claims)
5.  **Controversial practices and doctrines**
    
    -   Soundness: _8_ (The existence of controversial practices and doctrines is undeniable, but their implications for the truth of the church's claims are subjective)
    -   Bias: _5_ (Focusing on these issues may be seen as an attempt to discredit the church, but they are valid concerns)
    -   Logical consistency: _7_ (The argument is coherent, but it does not necessarily disprove the church's claims)
    -   Fallacious reasoning: _5_ (Controversial practices and doctrines do not necessarily imply falsehood or discredit the church's claims, but they raise questions about its teachings)
